# Air Quality Analysis Project

## Project Objectives

- **Analyzing Air Quality Trends:** This project aims to analyze historical air quality data to identify long-term trends, assess improvements or deteriorations in air quality over time, and explore seasonality in air quality data.

- **Identifying Pollution Hotspots:** We will identify geographical areas with consistently poor air quality, referred to as pollution hotspots. We will also investigate the factors contributing to pollution in these hotspots and determine if there are any changes in their locations over time.

- **Building a Predictive Model for RSPM/PM10 Levels:** Developing a predictive model for forecasting RSPM (Respirable Suspended Particulate Matter) or PM10 (Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less) levels using historical air quality data and relevant environmental and meteorological variables.

## Analysis Approach

### Data Loading

We will gather historical air quality data from reliable sources, ensuring it is in a format suitable for analysis (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a database).

### Data Preprocessing

- Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
- Convert and standardize units of measurement if necessary.
- Merge additional data sources (e.g., weather data, location data) if they provide valuable context.

### Data Analysis

- Calculate descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of air quality parameters.
- Perform time series analysis to identify trends, seasonality, and patterns.
- Conduct statistical tests or machine learning techniques to explore relationships between pollution levels and potential contributing factors.

### Data Visualization

We will use various data visualization techniques to effectively communicate findings:

- **Line Charts:** To visualize temporal trends in air quality parameters over time.
- **Heatmaps:** To represent geographical pollution hotspots.
- **Scatter Plots:** To explore relationships between air quality parameters and potential contributing factors.
- **Box Plots:** To visualize seasonal variations in air quality.

## Visualization Selection

1. **Line Charts:** Used for visualizing temporal trends in air quality parameters (e.g., RSPM/PM10 levels) over time.

2. **Heatmaps:** Created to represent geographical pollution hotspots, highlighting areas with consistently high pollution levels.

3. **Scatter Plots:** Utilized to explore relationships between air quality parameters and potential contributing factors, helping identify correlations or dependencies.

4. **Box Plots:** Used to visualize seasonal variations in air quality, displaying median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

5. **Interactive Dashboards:** Consider creating interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI to allow stakeholders to explore the data and findings dynamically.
